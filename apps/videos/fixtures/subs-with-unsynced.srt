00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,009
Grafitti Markup Language

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,003
my name is Evan dfdfd

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:10,004
fI am an artist and I'm going to talk about grafitti markup languagefdfd

4
00:00:10,004 --> 00:00:12,005
my work happens between open source and popular culture

5
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:16,008
how to make open source interchange with popular culture

6
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:23,007
we also do a project called LaserTag, an open source software for grafitti writters

7
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:27,008
and the main thing I'm trying to come up with grafitti reasearch work is that

8
00:00:27,008 --> 00:00:31,006
combining contagious media like viral media and things that get popular on the web

9
00:00:31,006 --> 00:00:35,002
with source code is a good way to spread free culture

10
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,005
into communities that aren't used to hearing about that

11
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:44,000
so, the new project I'm talking about is the same idea only combining open data with popular culture

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,008
and how to make that popular and interesting, all right?

13
00:00:47,008 --> 00:00:54,006
another software, open source project isabout capturing grafitti data

14
00:00:54,006 --> 00:01:00,002
and saving that digitally in a way that can be transfered easily between people

15
00:01:00,002 --> 00:01:02,002
and creates visuallizations

16
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:07,003
the application also exports this files in the grafitti markup language

17
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:10,005
which is meant to be a very accessible format

18
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:13,002
easy for hobbyist programmers and is essentially an XML file

19
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,000
with x, y and time coordinates

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,006
and there's also an online database

21
00:01:17,006 --> 00:01:21,003
that's an open database that uploads and downloads GML files

22
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:24,006
so you can upload a GML... download a GML...

23
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:27,002
and programmers can get involved by making applications

24
00:01:27,002 --> 00:01:30,001
so, things I've made with GML...

25
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:35,007
this is an application that takes in GML file, creates 3D data, and exports STL files

26
00:01:35,007 --> 00:01:38,005
which you can then import into Blender

27
00:01:38,006 --> 00:01:41,001
and send it to 3d-printers

28
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:44,007
so, I was making 3d prints of some grafitti data

29
00:01:44,007 --> 00:01:47,005
another project...

30
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:51,006
it's eye-writter, another project that uses GML

31
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:54,006
it's designed for a grafitti writer who may not move but his eyes

32
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:58,004
and so he can write grafitti with his eyes

33
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:00,004
this is open source software

34
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:03,009
and this software, like other software, also exports in the same file format

35
00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:06,005
and so these applications can now talk to each other and

36
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,006
developers are taking that data and doing interesting things

37
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:14,006
this is one taking GML file and using it to write to a robot

38
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:20,006
this is the same GML data used by an artist who is creating art with ping pong

39
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,004
it's just a different robot

40
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:24,006
online people are writting web-based applications

41
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,008
this is one in processing,

42
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,009
there's a canvas player, there's an SVG player

43
00:02:28,009 --> 00:02:32,002
Toby is working on a web marker app that takes in GML

44
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:35,005
and uses the open database so you can write tags in webpages

45
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:38,008
and so it's all about usefulness of having an open standard

46
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:43,000
and having different open source input devices, different open source export devices

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,005
but in the center is just an open data format and an online database that is completely open

48
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:51,004
and it is all about getting computer hackers and grafitti writers

49
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:54,003
hanging out more, talking more, making new projects

50
00:02:54,003 --> 00:02:58,005
and about getting open source spread to new communities

51
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:01,001
so getting this into places with people who might not be in a tech circles

52
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,005
people that might now be in grafitti circles

53
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:06,009
but this idea of hacking whether it is in the city or whether it is in code

54
00:03:06,009 --> 00:03:09,004
and getting this people sort of making projects together

55
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:15,000
so it is using grafitti as a way to sort of spread free culture into popular culture

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,004
and that's the big fish
