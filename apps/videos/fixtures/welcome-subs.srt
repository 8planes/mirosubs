00:00:00,004 --> 00:00:03,018
We started Universal Subtitles because we believe

2
00:00:03,018 --> 00:00:06,075
every video on the web should be subtitle-able.

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:11,017
Millions of deaf and hard of hearing viewers require subtitles to access videos.

4
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:15,040
Videomakers and websites should really care about this stuff too.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,074
Subtitles give them access to a wider audience and they also get better search rankings.

6
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:26,093
Universal Subtitles makes it incredibly easy to add subtitles to almost any video.

7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:32,043
Take an existing video on the web, submit the URL to our website

8
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:37,037
and then type along with the dialog to create the subtitles

9
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:43,065
After that, tap on your keyboard to sync them with the video.

10
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:47,052
Then you're doneâ€” we give you an embed code for the video

11
00:00:47,052 --> 00:00:49,089
that you can put on any website

12
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,042
at that point, viewers are able to use the subtitles and can also

13
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:56,004
contribute to translations.

14
00:00:56,004 --> 00:01:01,054
We support videos on YouTube, Blip.TV, Ustream, and many more.

15
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:05,010
Plus we're adding more services all the time

16
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,004
Universal Subtitles works with many popular video formats,

17
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:14,035
such as MP4, theora, webM and over html5.

18
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:19,061
Our goal is for every video on the web to be subtitlable so that anyone who cares about

19
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:23,031
the video can help make it more accessible.
