"    <h2>About Universal Subtitles</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The lack of captions and subtitles on video is a major obstacle for "
"people with hearing disabilities and a huge language barrier for the whole "
"world.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We want to give individuals and communities the power to overcome "
"these barriers. The tools we're building are free and open source and will "
"make the work of subtitling and translating video simpler, more appealing, "
"and, most of all, more collaborative.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>The benefits of captioning and subtitling are immense:</"
"strong>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            captions make video more accessible for people with hearing "
"disabilities\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            translated subtitles make it possible for all of us to watch "
"video in languages that we don't speak\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            as an educator, storyteller, scientist, or anyone with a "
"message, the potential size of your audience increases exponentially when "
"you have subtitles and translations\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>Universal Subtitles is composed of three main parts:</"
"strong>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            a subtitle creation and viewing tool (aka the widget)\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            a collaborative subtitling website\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            an open protocol for subtitle search/delivery\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>The subtitling widget</strong>\n"
"        currently exists as a browser-based javascript tool that features an "
"user friendly interface for adding captions to almost any video on the web "
"(without the hassle of re-transcoding or re-uploading). We're inviting "
"people to check it out and we're curious to know what you think.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>The collaborative website</strong>\n"
"        will develop as a space for collaborative subtitling and translating "
"videos.  The site will encourage dynamics like: formation of teams for "
"subtitling a program, or a topic; tracking which subtitling or translation "
"tasks are the most requested, and mobilizing volunteers; volunteers "
"recruiting their friends for help transcribing or translating a video.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>The protocol/open spec</strong>\n"
"        (still in the early stages) will allow clients such as Firefox "
"extensions, desktop video players, websites, or browsers to look up and "
"download matching subtitles from subtitle database(s).\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Everything we do will be available under the open source AGPL "

"            Help out new users!  Take a look at the <a href=\"/videos/"
