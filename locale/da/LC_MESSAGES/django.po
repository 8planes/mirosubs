"    <h2>About Universal Subtitles</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The lack of captions and subtitles on video is a major obstacle for "
"people with hearing disabilities and a huge language barrier for the whole "
"world.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        We want to give individuals and communities the power to overcome "
"these barriers. The tools we're building are free and open source and will "
"make the work of subtitling and translating video simpler, more appealing, "
"and, most of all, more collaborative.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>The benefits of captioning and subtitling are immense:</"
"strong>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            captions make video more accessible for people with hearing "
"disabilities\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            translated subtitles make it possible for all of us to watch "
"video in languages that we don't speak\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            as an educator, storyteller, scientist, or anyone with a "
"message, the potential size of your audience increases exponentially when "
"you have subtitles and translations\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>Universal Subtitles is composed of three main parts:</"
"strong>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            a subtitle creation and viewing tool (aka the widget)\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            a collaborative subtitling website\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            an open protocol for subtitle search/delivery\n"

"    </ul>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <strong>The subtitling widget</strong>\n"
"        currently exists as a browser-based javascript tool that features an "
"user friendly interface for adding captions to almost any video on the web "

"    <h2>Three Important Ways You Can Help</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Universal Subtitles is an open source, non-profit project.  We are "
"volunteer\n"
"        driven and would love to have your help!\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Here are three ways you can get involved:\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <ul>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Want to help us test new versions of the software before it's\n"
"            released? Join the testers list and follow our \n"
"            <a href=\"http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/"
"UniversalSubtitlesQA\">testing guidelines</a>\n"
"            to get started!\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            If you are a developer, check out the <a href=\"http://wiki."
"github.com/8planes/mirosubs/dev-center\">development center</a>\n"
"            and start with some 'bite-sized' tickets that are listed there.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"        <li>\n"
"            Help out new users!  Take a look at the <a href=\"/videos/"
"\">videos list</a>\n"
"            and give positive and helpful feedback to people that have added "
"subtitles to\n"
"            various videos.\n"
"        </li>\n"
"    </ul>\n"
"    <br/>\n"
"    <br/>\n"
"    <h2>Who's Behind the Project?</h2>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        <a href=\"http://www.pculture.org\">Participatory Culture "

"    <p>\n"
"        We are currently in the alpha stages of this website and the "
"subtitling tool-- that means we're just getting started!  But we've opened "
"up the site so that we can begin testing and get early feedback.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Many very important features are missing.  Here's some of what we'll "
"be working on in the coming months:\n"
"    </p>\n"
