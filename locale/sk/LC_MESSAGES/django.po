"    <h2>About Universal Subtitles</h2>\n"
"    \n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Universal Subtitles gives individuals, communities, and larger organizations the power \n"
"        to overcome accessibility and language barriers for online video. The tools are free \n"
"        and open source and make the work of subtitling and translating video simpler, more \n"
"        appealing, and, most of all, more collaborative.\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    \n"
"    <p>\n"
"        The benefits of captioning and subtitling are immense:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>Captions make videos accessible for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing</li>\n"
"            <li>Translations make it possible for all of us to watch video in languages that we don't speak</li>\n"
"            <li>Video creators get: better SEO, more views, access to a far bigger (potentially multilingual and global) audience, accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing viewers, and more</li>\n"
"        </ul>\n"
"    </p>\n"
"    \n"
"    <p>\n"
"        Universal Subtitles is composed of three main parts:\n"
"        <ul>\n"
"            <li>A subtitle creation and viewing tool (aka the widget)</li>\n"
"            <li>A collaborative subtitling website</li>\n"
