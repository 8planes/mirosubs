    <div id="why_meet">
        
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        
        <p>The focus of this summit is increased availability and better usability for captions and subtitles, which are both sorely needed. It comes at a critical time, as internet video usage is skyrocketing. People who rely on captions are threatened to be left behind. New users from every culture are coming online en masse; standardizing and ubiquitizing the technology can make potential audiences exponentially larger and messages can cross cultural boundaries more easily. More captions will also make it simpler for computers to process, index, and make sense of the ever growing sea of online video.</p>
