    <h2>About Universal Subtitles</h2>
    
    <p>
        Universal Subtitles gives individuals, communities, and larger organizations the power 
        to overcome accessibility and language barriers for online video. The tools are free 
        and open source and make the work of subtitling and translating video simpler, more 
        appealing, and, most of all, more collaborative.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The benefits of captioning and subtitling are immense:
        <ul>
            <li>Captions make videos accessible for viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing</li>
            <li>Translations make it possible for all of us to watch video in languages that we don't speak</li>
            <li>Video creators get: better SEO, more views, access to a far bigger (potentially multilingual and global) audience, accessibility for deaf and hard of hearing viewers, and more</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Universal Subtitles is composed of three main parts:
        <ul>
            <li>A subtitle creation and viewing tool (aka the widget)</li>
            <li>A collaborative subtitling website</li>
            <li>An open protocol for subtitle search/delivery</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>What's Coming Next?</h2>
    
    <p>
        We are currently in the alpha stages of this website and the subtitling tool-- that means we're just getting started! But we've opened up the site so that we can begin testing and get early feedback.
        Many very important features are missing. Here's some of what we'll be working on in the coming months:
        <ul>
            <li>Better support for non-latin character sets</li>
            <li>A volunteer page and request center, where people can ask for captions and subtitles</li>
            <li>Machine translation option once subtitles have been transcribed</li>
            <li>Better keyboard accessibility for site and widget</li>
            <li>Subtitle ratings and flagging</li>
            <li>Better community website features</li>
            <li>Better video browsing on our site, for finding interesting content</li>
            <li>Compliance with emerging timed text standards</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Are there other features that are particular important to your use? 
        We'd love to hear from you.<br/>
