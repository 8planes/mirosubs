.. _version-2.2.4:

2.2.4
=====

* celerybeat: DatabaseScheduler would not react to changes when using MySQL and
  the default transaction isolation level ``REPEATABLE-READ`` (Issue #41).

    It is still recommended that you use isolation level ``READ-COMMITTED``
    (see the Celery FAQ).

.. _version-2.2.3:

2.2.3
=====
:release-date: 2011-02-12 16:00 PM CET

* celerybeat: DatabaseScheduler did not respect the disabled setting after restart.

* celeryevcam: Expiring objects now works on PostgreSQL.

* Now requires Celery 2.2.3

.. _version-2.2.2:

2.2.2
=====
:release-date: 2011-02-03 16:00 PM CET

* Now requires Celery 2.2.2

.. _version-2.2.0:

=====
:release-date: 2011-02-01 10:00 AM CET

* Now depends on Celery v2.2.0

* djceleryadm: Adds task actions Kill and Terminate task

* celerycam: Django's queryset.delete() fetches everything in
  memory THEN deletes, so we need to use raw SQL to expire objects.

* djcelerymon: Added Command.stdout + Command.stderr  (Issue #23).

* Need to close any open database connection after any embedded
  celerybeat process forks.

* Added contrib/requirements/py25.txt

.. _version-2.1.1:

2.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2010-10-14 02:00 PM CEST

* Now depends on Celery v2.1.1.

* Snapshots: Fixed bug with losing events.

* Snapshots: Limited the number of worker timestamp updates to once every second.

* Snapshot: Handle transaction manually and commit every 100 task updates.

* snapshots: Can now configure when to expire task events.

    New settings:

    * ``CELERYCAM_EXPIRE_SUCCESS`` (default 1 day),
    * ``CELERYCAM_EXPIRE_ERROR`` (default 3 days), and
    * ``CELERYCAM_EXPIRE_PENDING`` (default 5 days).

* Snapshots: ``TaskState.args`` and ``TaskState.kwargs`` are now
  represented as ``TextField`` instead of ``CharField``.

    If you need to represent arguments larger than 200 chars you have
    to migrate the table.

* ``transaction.commit_manually`` doesn't accept arguments on older
  Django version.

    Should now work with Django versions previous to v1.2.

* The tests doesn't need :mod:`unittest2` anymore if running on Python 2.7.

Important Notes
---------------

This release depends on Celery version 2.1.0.
Be sure to read the Celery changelog before you upgrade:
http://ask.github.com/celery/changelog.html#version-2-1-0

News
----

* The periodic task schedule can now be stored in the database and edited via
  the Django Admin interface.

    To use the new database schedule you need to start ``celerybeat`` with the
    following argument::

        $ python manage.py celerybeat -S djcelery.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler

    Note that you need to add your old periodic tasks to the database manually
    (using the Django admin interface for example).

* New Celery monitor for the Django Admin interface.

    To start monitoring your workers you have to start your workers
    in event mode::

        $ python manage.py celeryd -E

    (you can do this without restarting the server too::

        >>> from celery.task.control import broadcast
        >>> broadcast("enable_events")

    You need to do a syncdb to create the new tables:

        python manage.py syncdb

    Then you need to start the snapshot camera::

        $ python manage.py celerycam -f 2.0

    This will take a snapshot of the events every 2 seconds and store it in
    the database.

Fixes
-----

* database backend: Now shows warning if polling results with transaction isolation level
  repeatable-read on MySQL.

    See http://github.com/ask/django-celery/issues/issue/6

* database backend: get result does no longer store the default result to
  database.

    See http://github.com/ask/django-celery/issues/issue/6

2.0.2
=====

Important notes
---------------

* Due to some applications loading the Django models lazily, it is recommended
  that you add the following lines to your ``settings.py``::

       import djcelery
       djcelery.setup_loader()

    This will ensure the Django celery loader is set even though the
    model modules haven't been imported yet.

News
----

* ``djcelery.views.registered_tasks``: Added a view to list currently known
  tasks.

2.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2010-07-02 02:30 P.M CEST

* Initial release
