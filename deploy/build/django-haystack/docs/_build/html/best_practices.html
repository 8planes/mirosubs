<p>What follows are some general recommendations on how to improve your search.
Some tips represent performance benefits, some provide a better search index.
You should evaluate these options for yourself and pick the ones that will
work best for you. Not all situations are created equal and many of these
options could be considered mandatory in some cases and unnecessary premature
optimizations in others. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<div class="section" id="good-search-needs-good-content">
<h2>Good Search Needs Good Content<a class="headerlink" href="#good-search-needs-good-content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most search engines work best when they&#8217;re given corpuses with predominantly
text (as opposed to other data like dates, numbers, etc.) in decent quantities
(more than a couple words). This is in stark contrast to the databases most
people are used to, which rely heavily on non-text data to create relationships
and for ease of querying.</p>
<p>To this end, if search is important to you, you should take the time to
carefully craft your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> subclasses to give the search engine the
best information you can. This isn&#8217;t necessarily hard but is worth the
investment of time and thought. Assuming you&#8217;ve only ever used the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BasicSearchIndex</span></tt>, in creating custom <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> classes, there are
some easy improvements to make that will make your search better:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">document=True</span></tt> field, use a well-constructed template.</li>
<li>Add fields for data you might want to be able to filter by.</li>
<li>If the model has related data, you can squash good content from those
related models into the parent model&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt>.</li>
<li>Similarly, if you have heavily de-normalized models, it may be best
represented by a single indexed model rather than many indexed models.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="well-constructed-templates">
<h3>Well-Constructed Templates<a class="headerlink" href="#well-constructed-templates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A relatively unique concept in Haystack is the use of templates associated with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> fields. These are data templates, will never been seen by users
and ideally contain no HTML. They are used to collect various data from the
model and structure it as a document for the search engine to analyze and index.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you read nothing else, this is the single most important thing you can
do to make search on your site better for your users. Good templates can
make or break your search and providing the search engine with good content
to index is critical.</p>
</div>
<p>Good templates structure the data well and incorporate as much pertinent text
as possible. This may include additional fields such as titles, author
information, metadata, tags/categories. Without being artificial, you want to
construct as much context as you can. This doesn&#8217;t mean you should necessarily
include every field, but you should include fields that provide good content
or include terms you think your users may frequently search on.</p>
<p>Unless you have very unique numbers or dates, neither of these types of data
are a good fit within templates. They are usually better suited to other
fields for filtering within a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchQuerySet</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-fields-for-filtering">
<h3>Additional Fields For Filtering<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-fields-for-filtering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Documents by themselves are good for generating indexes of content but are
generally poor for filtering content, for instance, by date. All search engines
supported by Haystack provide a means to associate extra data as
attributes/fields on a record. The database analogy would be adding extra
columns to the table for filtering.</p>
<p>Good candidates here are date fields, number fields, de-normalized data from
related objects, etc. You can expose these things to users in the form of a
calendar range to specify, an author to look up or only data from a certain
series of numbers to return.</p>
<p>You will need to plan ahead and anticipate what you might need to filter on,
though with each field you add, you increase storage space usage. It&#8217;s generally
<strong>NOT</strong> recommended to include every field from a model, just ones you are
likely to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="related-data">
<h3>Related Data<a class="headerlink" href="#related-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Related data is somewhat problematic to deal with, as most search engines are
better with documents than they are with relationships. One way to approach this
is to de-normalize a related child object or objects into the parent&#8217;s document
template. The inclusion of a foreign key&#8217;s relevant data or a simple Django
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{%</span> <span class="pre">for</span> <span class="pre">%}</span></tt> templatetag to iterate over the related objects can increase the
salient data in your document. Be careful what you include and how you structure
it, as this can have consequences on how well a result might rank in your
search.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="avoid-hitting-the-database">
<h2>Avoid Hitting The Database<a class="headerlink" href="#avoid-hitting-the-database" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A very easy but effective thing you can do to drastically reduce hits on the
database is to pre-render your search results using stored fields then disabling
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_all</span></tt> aspect of your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchView</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This technique may cause a substantial increase in the size of your index
as you are basically using it as a storage mechanism.</p>
</div>
<p>To do this, you setup one or more stored fields (<cite>indexed=False</cite>) on your
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> classes. You should specify a template for the field, filling it
with the data you&#8217;d want to display on your search results pages. When the model
attached to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> is placed in the index, this template will get
rendered and stored in the index alongside the record.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The downside of this method is that the HTML for the result will be locked
in once it is indexed. To make changes to the structure, you&#8217;d have to
reindex all of your content. It also limits you to a single display of the
content (though you could use multiple fields if that suits your needs).</p>
</div>
<p>The second aspect is customizing your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchView</span></tt> and its templates. First,
pass the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_all=False</span></tt> to your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchView</span></tt>, ideally in your URLconf.
This prevents the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchQuerySet</span></tt> from loading all models objects for results
ahead of time. Then, in your template, simply display the stored content from
your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> as the HTML result.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">To do this, you must absolutely avoid using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">{{</span> <span class="pre">result.object</span> <span class="pre">}}</span></tt> or any
further accesses beyond that. That call will hit the database, not only
nullifying your work on lessening database hits, but actually making it
worse as there will now be at least query for each result, up from a single
query for each type of model with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load_all=True</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="real-time-search">
<h2>Real-Time Search<a class="headerlink" href="#real-time-search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your site sees heavy search traffic and up-to-date information is very important,
Haystack provides a way to constantly keep your index up to date. By using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">RealTimeSearchIndex</span></tt> class instead of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> class, Haystack will
automatically update the index whenever a model is saved/deleted.</p>
<p>You can find more information within the <a class="reference external" href="searchindex_api.html"><em>SearchIndex API</em></a> documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-of-a-queue-for-a-better-user-experience">
<h2>Use Of A Queue For A Better User Experience<a class="headerlink" href="#use-of-a-queue-for-a-better-user-experience" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, you have to manually reindex content, Haystack immediately tries to merge
it into the search index. If you have a write-heavy site, this could mean your
search engine may spend most of its time churning on constant merges. If you can
afford a small delay between when a model is saved and when it appears in the
search results, queuing these merges is a good idea.</p>
<p>You gain a snappier interface for users as updates go into a queue (a fast
operation) and then typical processing continues. You also get a lower churn
rate, as most search engines deal with batches of updates better than many
single updates. You can also use this to distribute load, as the queue consumer
could live on a completely separate server from your webservers, allowing you
to tune more efficiently.</p>
<p>Implementing this is relatively simple. There are two parts, creating a new
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QueuedSearchIndex</span></tt> class and creating a queue processing script to handle the
actual updates.</p>
<p>For the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">QueuedSearchIndex</span></tt>, simply inherit from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> provided
by Haystack and override the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_setup_save</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">_setup_delete</span></tt> methods. These
methods usually attach themselves to their model&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_save</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">post_delete</span></tt>
signals and call the backend to update or remove a record. You should override
this behavior and place a message in your queue of choice. At a minimum, you&#8217;ll
want to include the model you&#8217;re indexing and the id of the model within that
message, so that you can retrieve the proper index from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchSite</span></tt> in
your consumer. Then alter all of your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt> classes to inherit from
this new class. Now all saves/deletes will be handled by the queue and you
should receive a speed boost.</p>
<p>For the consumer, this is much more specific to the queue used and your desired
setup. At a minimum, you will need to periodically consume the queue, fetch the
correct index from the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchSite</span></tt> for your application, load the model from
the message and pass that model to the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">update_object</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">remove_object</span></tt>
methods on the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SearchIndex</span></tt>. Proper grouping, batching and intelligent
handling are all additional things that could be applied on top to further
improve performance.</p>
