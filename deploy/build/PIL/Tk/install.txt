Using PIL With Tkinter 
====================================================================

Starting with 1.0 final (release candidate 2 and later, to be
precise), PIL can attach itself to Tkinter in flight.  As a result,
you no longer need to rebuild the Tkinter extension to be able to
use PIL.

However, if you cannot get the this to work on your platform, you
can do it in the old way:

* Adding Tkinter support

1. Compile Python's _tkinter.c with the WITH_APPINIT and WITH_PIL
   flags set, and link it with tkImaging.c and tkappinit.c.  To
   do this, copy the former to the Modules directory, and edit
   the _tkinter line in Setup (or Setup.in) according to the
   instructions in that file.

   NOTE: if you have an old Python version, the tkappinit.c
   file is not included by default.  If this is the case, you
   will have to add the following lines to tkappinit.c, after
   the MOREBUTTONS stuff:

	{
	    extern void TkImaging_Init(Tcl_Interp* interp);
	    TkImaging_Init(interp);
	}

   This registers a Tcl command called "PyImagingPhoto", which is
   use to communicate between PIL and Tk's PhotoImage handler.

   You must also change the _tkinter line in Setup (or Setup.in)
   to something like:

   _tkinter _tkinter.c tkImaging.c tkappinit.c -DWITH_APPINIT
	-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.0 -ltcl8.0 -lX11
