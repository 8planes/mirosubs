and demo programs.

Comments and contributions are welcome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
pildriver.py (by Eric S. Raymond)

A class implementing an image-processing calculator for scripts.
Parses lists of commnds (or, called interactively, command-line
arguments) into image loads, transformations, and saves.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------
viewer.py

A simple image viewer.  Can display all file formats handled by
PIL.  Transparent images are properly handled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
thresholder.py

A simple utility that demonstrates how a transparent 1-bit overlay
can be used to show the current thresholding of an 8-bit image.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
enhancer.py

Illustrates the ImageEnhance module.  Drag the sliders to modify the
images.  This might be very slow on some platforms, depending on the
Tk version.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
painter.py

Illustrates how a painting program could be based on PIL and Tk.
Press the left mouse button and drag over the image to remove the
colour.  Some clever tricks have been used to get decent performance
when updating the screen; see the sources for details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
player.py

A simple image sequence player.  You can use either a sequence format
like FLI/FLC, GIF, or ARG, or give a number of images which are
interpreted as frames in a sequence.  All frames must have the same
size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
gifmaker.py

Convert a sequence file to a GIF animation.

Note that the GIF encoder provided with this release of PIL writes
uncompressed GIF files only, so the resulting animations are rather
large compared with these created by other tools.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
explode.py

Split a sequence file into individual frames.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
image2py.py

Convert an image to a Python module containing an IMAGE variable.
Note that the module using the module must include JPEG and ZIP
decoders, unless the -u option is used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
olesummary.py

Uses the OleFileIO module to dump the summary information from an OLE
structured storage file.  This works with most OLE files, including
Word documents, FlashPix images, etc.

Note that datetime fields currently show the number of seconds since
January 1st, 1601.
