To run the development version:

1. Git clone the repository:

       git clone git://github.com/8planes/mirosubs.git mirosubs

   Now the entire project will be in the mirosubs directory.

2. Install virtualenv http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

3. (optional) download and download the virtualenv wrapper bash
   functions http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/

4. Create a virtual environment and activate it. Here is how to do it 
   *without* the virtualenv wrapper. Run these commands from the parent 
   of the mirosubs directory created in #1:

   $ virtualenv mirosubs-env
   $ source mirosubs-env/bin/activate

   If you're using the virtualenv wrapper (run from any directory):

   $ mkvirtualenv mirosubs
   $ workon mirosubs

5. run:
   $ easy_install -U setuptools
   $ easy_install pip
   $ cd deploy
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
       note: you'll need mercurial installed to make this last command work.

6. Check out google closure into directory of your choice: svn checkout 
   http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <directory>. Then 
   symlink media/js/closure-library to the checkout location.

7. Add mirosubs.example.com to your hosts file, pointing at 127.0.0.1. 
   This is necessary for Twitter oauth to work correctly.

8. From the unisubs directory created in step 1, use the dev-settings file when 
   running manage.py. First create the database with

       python manage.py syncdb

   Then update the database with

       python manage.py migrate

   SQLLite warnings are okay. Then run the site with:

       ./dev-runserver.sh

   You can access the site at http://mirosubs.example.com:8000.

9. (optional) If you want to run video searches locally, you need to set up solr:
   A. Download solr and unzip to ../buildout/parts/solr (relative to this directory).
   B. Run ./manage.py run_solr in one terminal that is dedicated to running the solr process.
   C. run ./manage.py rebuild_index to update the index.
   D. That should be it but, in case you're interested, there's a 
      list of haystack commands at 
      http://docs.haystacksearch.org/dev/management_commands.html
