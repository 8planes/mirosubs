2. (optional) download and download the virtualenv wrapper bash
  functions http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/
3. create a virtual environment and activate it
4. run:
   $ easy_install -U setuptools
   $ easy_install pip
   $ cd deploy
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
       note: you'll need mercurial installed to make this last command work.
5. Check out google closure into directory of your choice: svn checkout 
   http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <directory>. Then 
   symlink media/js/closure-library to the checkout location.
6. Add mirosubs.example.com to your hosts file, pointing at 127.0.0.1. 
   This is necessary for Twitter oauth to work correctly.
7. After running syncdb, use manage.py runserver --settings=dev-settings 
   to run the development server with development settings. You can access 
   the site at http://mirosubs.example.com:8000.
